MAD LIBS!

We've all played the classic game Mad Libs created by Leonard Stern. Now it's time for me to make it!

This is actually the source code for "Libs Engine", a templated make-your-own-Mad Libs. Here's a tutorial on how to compile it.

## COMPILING IT

This guide is for Visual Studio Code, because that's what I used to program it. Don't worry, Visual Studio Code is free.

## STEP 1 - DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE CODE

You'll need every file in the repository to compile this. Every single one. Just download it as a ZIP and extract to somewhere you like.

## STEP 2 - GET THE NEEDED EXTENSIONS

You'll need the C# extension to compile it properly, as well as .NET Core 3.1. You can get the C# extension in the Visual Studio Code extensions, and .NET on Microsoft's
own website. Just search ".net core" and you'll find it.

## STEP 3 - IMPORTING WHAT'S NECESSARY

You'll need to open the folder that Libs Engine resides in. You can do that by simply clicking "Open Folder" or Ctrl+K in VSCode.

## STEP 4 - MAKE SOME CHANGES (mandatory if publishing, optional if you aren't)

Libs Engine is just a template for a full Windows console Mad Libs. This means that you'll need to A. write your own stories B. making changes to how everything works
or C. all of the above. Also, if you publish your Mad Libs game, you must give credit to me and Lemon. I will give you our Twitters upon request.

## STEP 5 - COMPILE THE DAMN GAME

Just press F5 on your Program.cs editor. It should build. It builds in bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1

## ONE MORE THING

If you look in the obj folder, there will be a file just called "thing". I made that file to create the folder. It's nothing important.

Thanks for reading!
